# Welcome!

This project is a test project for better code structure and object orientated programming.


It may have some bugs in the middle of developing, but it could eventually become a complete and bugless project,
which means this could be a really simple project.


Also, this project is for designing the RPG game as well. So you may see some codes are about games.
